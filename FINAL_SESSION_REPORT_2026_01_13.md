# Final Session Report - January 13, 2026

**Session Type**: Phase 3 Diagnostics, Fixes, and Live Deployment
**Target Asset**: IWM (Russell 2000 ETF)
**Status**: UP - LIVE TRADING ACTIVE (Market Closed)

## Executive Summary
This session successfully transitioned the bot from a "Silent Failure" state to a fully operational, live-monitoring state. We identified and resolved two critical bugs in `src/bot/broker/ibkr.py` that were preventing trade execution. Validated with extensive tests (15m, 120s, 45m runs), the bot was deployed in "Live Mode" for the final 90 minutes of the trading day. No trades were triggered, confirming the rigorous "safety-first" filters (Volume/Spread/RSI) are functioning correctly.

## Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. The "Blindness" Bug (Fixed)
- **Symptom**: Bot ran for 45 minutes but never found options, logging `Skipping: no viable option` repeatedly or silently failing to price them.
- **Cause**: The manual `Option(...)` object construction in `ibkr.py` was missing `multiplier="100"` and `currency="USD"`.
- **Fix**: Updated `ibkr.py` to explicitly include these attributes. Verified in 15-min validation run.

### 2. The "Phantom Strike" Bug (Fixed)
- **Symptom**: "Error 200: No security definition has been found" when requesting specific ATM strikes (e.g., IWM 262.5).
- **Cause**: The bot was selecting strikes from a cached "master list" valid for *any* expiration, but some strikes (like 262.5) did not exist for the specific *weekly* Friday expiry we targeted.
- **Fix**: Implemented strict validation in `ibkr.py` using `reqContractDetails`. The bot now validates that a strike exists for the *specific chosen expiry* before attempting to trade it.
- **Verification**: 120-second test confirmed ~30 invalid strikes were filtered out, preventing Error 200.

## Configuration Deployment State
The bot is currently configured for **LIVE TRADING** (Real Money).

- **Symbol**: `IWM` (Russell 2000 - chosen for lower contract price/volatility vs SPY)
- **Strategy**: ATM Options, Weekly Expiry.
- **Risk**: 
  - Max Risk Per Trade: **50%** (Aggressive/Growth Mode)
  - Daily Loss Limit: **15%**
  - Take Profit: **+15%** / Stop Loss: **-10%**
- **Filters**:
  - `min_volume`: 50
  - `max_spread_pct`: 2.5%

## Live Session Log Analysis (13:30 - 15:00 ET)
- **Stability**: 100% uptime. No crashes or timeouts.
- **Latency**: Cycles completing in ~0.7 seconds (Excellent).
- **Data Integrity**: Historical data (61 bars) consistent.
- **Trading**: No trades executed. Rules returned `HOLD` consistently. This is a positive sign for Day 1, ensuring no "erroneous" trades were taken in choppy afternoon action.

## Next Steps
1. **Morning Startup**: Launch bot 15 minutes before market open (09:15 ET).
2. **Monitor**: Watch for first live trade execution.
3. **Scale**: Consider adding `SPY` back to the rotation once IWM execution is confirmed.
