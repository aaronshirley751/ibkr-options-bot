# Session Report: Friday, January 16, 2026

**Status**: ✅ Success (Operational)  
**P&L**: $0.00 (0 Trades)  
**Market Hours**: 09:30 - 16:00 EST  
**Bot Run Time**: 09:18 - 16:13 EST (Approx. 7 hours)  

## 1. Executive Summary
The bot executed a full-day "set and forget" session without interruption. Connection to IBKR Gateway remained stable throughout the day. Technical operations were flawless, with automatic log rotation handling the large volume of market data processing. No trades were triggered, indicating that the `Whale` strategy's strict entry criteria (20-day High/Low breakout + 1.5x Volume Spike) were not met by the monitored symbols (TSLA, NVDA, AMD) during the session.

## 2. Operational Highlights
- **Startup**: Bot initialized at ~09:18 EST (08:18 CST), successfully pre-fetching historical data before market open.
- **Stability**: Maintained active connection for >6.5 hours. Log rotation occurred seamlessly at ~12:20 EST and ~13:47 EST (converted from CST), preserving all data.
- **Shutdown**: Clean shutdown initiated via user SIGINT at 16:13 EST (15:13 CST).

## 3. Trading Activity
| Symbol | Signals Generated | Trades Executed | Reason for No Trades |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **TSLA** | 0                 | 0               | No Breakout + Volume condition met |
| **NVDA** | 0                 | 0               | No Breakout + Volume condition met |
| **AMD**  | 0                 | 0               | No Breakout + Volume condition met |

**Strategy Note**: The "Whale" strategy is designed to be highly selective. Days with zero trades are expected during consolidation or low-volume trends. The bot correctly issued "HOLD" signals (Confidence 0.0) throughout the day.

## 4. Technical Observations
- **Logs**: Generated ~3 distinct JSONL files due to size limits (approx 10MB each), ensuring no data loss.
- **Latency**: Cycle times remained low (~2.6s for 3 symbols), well within the 1-minute bar limit.
- **Timezone**: Logs confirm local execution in CST (UTC-6), correctly syncing with EST market data (UTC-5).

## 5. Next Steps
- **Review Strategy Sensitivity**: Consider if the `volume_threshold` (1.5x) or `lookback` (20 days) is too conservative for the current volatility regime.
- **Weekend Maintenance**: 
    - Archive logs to `logs/archive/`.
    - Update `settings.yaml` if parameter tuning is decided.
- **Next Session**: Tuesday, January 20, 2026 (Monday is MLK Market Holiday).
