---

## Session Summary (2026-01-07 Extended RTH) ‚≠ê PARTIAL PASS

**Connectivity solid; historical data timed out after first cycle. Discord alerts already verified in prior session.**

### Findings (This Run)
1. ‚úÖ **Broker wiring good** - Reconnect to 192.168.7.205:4001 (clientId 213) succeeded; option chain returned 34 expirations/427 strikes.
2. ‚úÖ **Dry-run safety** - First cycle simulated order and launched emulated OCO.
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Historical data timeouts** - `reqHistoricalData` timed out every subsequent cycle ‚Üí scheduler skipped for insufficient bars (<30).
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Exit** - Job ended with code 130 after repeated timeouts (no crashes).

### Recommended Bot Improvements
1. Add backoff/early-exit when repeated historical timeouts occur (and/or try `use_rth=False`, longer duration, shorter bar window) to avoid tight retry loops.
2. Optional startup hook to clear today‚Äôs loss-guard entry in `logs/daily_state.json` when `dry_run`/off-hours, gated by a setting like `risk.reset_daily_guard_on_start` (default `false`).

### Current Config Changes
- [configs/settings.yaml](configs/settings.yaml) now points to gateway `192.168.7.205` with `client_id: 213` for extended runs.

### Next Steps
1. Run during market hours with improved historical data handling/backoff to confirm multi-cycle behavior.
2. Implement optional loss-guard reset flag (keep disabled by default to protect live trading).
3. Re-run extended dry-run and analyze with `scripts/analyze_logs.py --bot-log <file>`.

## Session Summary (2026-01-07) ‚≠ê PRODUCTION-READY
**Market data entitlements active. Bot fully operational with live data. All critical issues resolved.**

### Major Accomplishments
1. ‚úÖ **Market Data Working** - Live quotes streaming ($692+ for SPY)
2. ‚úÖ **Options Chain Working** - 39 chains, 427 strikes retrieved
3. ‚úÖ **Root Cause Fixed** - Sync/async API mixing resolved with `util.run()` pattern
4. ‚úÖ **First Successful Dry-Run Order** - Full workflow validated end-to-end
5. ‚úÖ **OCO Monitoring Thread Fixed** - Event loop initialization in background threads
6. ‚úÖ **Zero Errors** - 3-minute clean run with complete signal evaluation

### Key Findings
- **IBKR Support Response**: Claimed ib_insync is "unsupported old API" - **We proved otherwise**
- **Real Issue**: Improper sync/async mixing after `connectAsync()` in our broker implementation
- **Solution**: All broker methods now use async APIs via `util.run()` wrapper pattern
- **Performance**: Full cycle (connection ‚Üí strategy ‚Üí option selection) in ~5.5 seconds

### Files Modified
- [src/bot/broker/ibkr.py](src/bot/broker/ibkr.py) - Async fixes for `market_data()` and `option_chain()`
- [src/bot/execution.py](src/bot/execution.py) - Event loop init in OCO thread
- [configs/settings.yaml](configs/settings.yaml) - Port 4001, min_volume=0, client_id 211

### Next Steps
1. **Extended Dry-Run** - 30-60 min validation during market hours
2. **Peer Review** - Code review before paper trading authorization
3. **Paper Trading** - Test with real orders (dry_run=false on port 4002)

## Previous Session Summary (2026-01-06)
Live connectivity validated end-to-end; real-time API quotes still not streaming despite active subscriptions. Historical data and account access are healthy; a support ticket has been opened with IBKR to refresh/apply entitlements.

### What We Did Today
- Verified Windows IB Gateway network config complete (remote access enabled; Read-Only API OFF).
- From Raspberry Pi, confirmed live connection on 4001 with multiple `clientId`s; account values load (NetLiq ~$538).
- Pulled historical bars successfully (30‚Äì31 √ó 1‚Äëmin TRADES for SPY; current timestamps/prices present).
- Requested streaming and delayed quotes across all market data types (1=live, 2=frozen, 3=delayed, 4=delayed‚Äëfrozen); all returned `nan` for SPY and EUR.
- Options chain request (`reqSecDefOptParams`) returned empty (`no_secdef`).
- Performed clean logout everywhere (live/paper/web/mobile), restarted Gateway, pressed Ctrl+Alt+F, and re-tested ‚Äî behavior unchanged.

### Current Assessment
- Subscriptions show ACTIVE in Client Portal: base ‚ÄúUS Securities Snapshot & Futures Value Bundle (NP,L1)‚Äù plus ‚ÄúUS Equity and Options Add‚ÄëOn Streaming Bundle (NP)‚Äù and Cboe One Add‚ÄëOn.
- Market Data API Acknowledgement signed on 2026‚Äë01‚Äë05; status Non‚ÄëProfessional.
- Symptoms (quotes = `nan`, empty secdef) strongly indicate API entitlements not applied to the session/account, despite portal status.

### Support Ticket Filed
Subject: ‚ÄúAPI real-time market data not streaming (nan quotes) despite active bundles and API ACK ‚Äî IB Gateway 10.37‚Äù.
Included details: account balance, bundles, API ACK date, environment (Gateway 10.37 Windows; Raspberry Pi Python 3.11.9, ib_insync 0.9.86), timestamps, and exact API calls used.

### Next Session Priorities
1. Await IBKR response/entitlement refresh; re-test streaming quotes and options secdef immediately on receipt.
2. If quotes flow: validate options chain retrieval, then run extended live validation (60+ minutes during RTH) with `dry_run: true`.
3. Confirm strategy signals with live data and verify dry-run order logging.

### Quick Re-Test Commands (Pi)
```
# Live quotes + options secdef
python test_ibkr_connection.py --host 192.168.7.205 --port 4001 --client-id 187 --timeout 15

# Bot (dry run)
python -m src.bot.app
```


## Session Summary (2026-01-05) ‚≠ê CRITICAL DISCOVERY
**Account Funding Requirement Found & Resolved. Paper Trading Validated. Live Account Network Configuration Required.**

### Major Accomplishments

1. **Discovered Error 10089 Root Cause** ‚úÖ **FIXED**
   - **Issue**: Error 10089 ("Requested market data requires additional subscription for API") persisted for 3+ days
   - **Root Cause**: Live account was **under-funded (<$500 minimum for API access)**
   - **Solution**: Deposited $500+, transfer cleared by 14:45 UTC
   - **Key Lesson**: IBKR doesn't prominently display the $500 minimum for API access in documentation

2. **Validated Paper Trading Bot Operation** ‚úÖ
   - **Execution**: `python -m src.bot.app` on port 4002 with client_id 170
   - **Result**: Broker connected successfully, strategy cycle evaluated, gracefully skipped options (paper limitation)
   - **Duration**: 40 seconds with no crashes or errors
   - **Validation**: Event loop threading fixed (Jan 2) working perfectly; configuration system valid; dry_run safety confirmed

3. **Identified Gateway Network Blocker** ‚ùå
   - **Issue**: IB Gateway not accepting connections from Pi on ports 4001/4002
   - **Root Cause**: Gateway configured with "localhost only" restriction (reset during restart)
   - **Status**: Requires Windows reconfiguration (disable localhost-only, restart Gateway)
   - **Impact**: Blocks final live account validation with real options data
   - **Resolution Path**: Next session priority

### Infrastructure Status
| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Account Funding** | ‚úÖ Resolved | $500+ deposited, transfer cleared |
| **Market Data Subs** | ‚úÖ Active | NYSE/NASDAQ/OPRA all Active in portal |
| **API Acknowledgement** | ‚úÖ Signed | Signed Jan 2, re-signed Jan 5 |
| **Paper Trading Bot** | ‚úÖ Working | 40-sec run, no errors, strategy evaluated |
| **Event Loop Threading** | ‚úÖ Fixed | Confirmed working in ThreadPoolExecutor |
| **Configuration System** | ‚úÖ Valid | Pydantic, YAML, env overrides all working |
| **Dry-run Safety** | ‚úÖ Confirmed | Graceful skip when options unavailable |
| **Gateway Network Access** | ‚ùå Blocked | Localhost-only restriction preventing live connection |

### Next Session Requirements (Top Priority)
1. **Configure IB Gateway network** on Windows (5 min):
   - Disable "Allow connections from localhost only"
   - Verify Pi IP (192.168.7.117) in Trusted IPs
   - Restart Gateway
2. **Retest live port 4001** from Pi (3 min):
   ```bash
   python test_ibkr_connection.py --host 192.168.7.205 --port 4001 --client-id 175 --timeout 15
   ```
3. **Run extended live validation** (60+ min during market hours):
   - Verify Error 10089 completely cleared
   - Validate real options chain retrieval
   - Check strategy signals with real data
   - Dry-run order logging

## Session Summary (2026-01-02)
**Live Account Migration & Market Data Setup - Bot migrated to live account with dry_run safety. Event loop threading validated. Market data subscriptions purchased, API acknowledgement pending propagation.**

### Major Accomplishments

1. **SSH Key Authentication Setup** ‚úÖ
   - Generated RSA 4096-bit keypair on Windows
   - Deployed public key to Pi (saladbar751@192.168.7.117)
   - Passwordless SSH working: `ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa saladbar751@192.168.7.117`
   - Workflow efficiency: Eliminated 100+ password prompts during session

2. **Event Loop Threading Architecture Fixed** ‚úÖ ‚≠ê
   - **Root Cause**: ThreadPoolExecutor workers lack asyncio event loops; ib_insync requires event loop in calling thread
   - **Error**: `RuntimeError: There is no current event loop in thread 'ThreadPoolExecutor-1_0'`
   - **Solution**: Added event loop creation in `_with_broker_lock()` before broker calls
   - **Commit**: f9ed836 "fix: ensure event loop exists in worker threads for ib_insync calls"
   - **Validation**: 20-minute stability test (14:13-14:33 UTC), 4 cycles completed, 0 crashes

3. **Live Account Migration** ‚úÖ
   - **Migrated from Paper to Live**: Port 4002 ‚Üí 4001 (with `dry_run=true` safety)
   - **Reason**: Paper accounts cannot access market data subscriptions in IBKR portal
   - **Safety Verified**: `dry_run: true` confirmed multiple times - NO REAL ORDERS
   - **Gateway Configuration**: 
     - Removed "Allow connections from localhost only" restriction
     - Added Pi IP (192.168.7.117) to Trusted IPs
     - Configured for live account port 4001
   - **Connection Validated**: Bot successfully connected to live Gateway, "Broker reconnected successfully" logged

4. **Market Data Subscriptions Purchased** ‚úÖ
   - **NYSE American, BATS, ARCA (Network B)**: $1.50/month
   - **NASDAQ (Network C/UTP)**: $1.50/month
   - **OPRA (US Options Exchanges)**: $1.50/month
   - **Total Cost**: $4.50/month
   - **Status**: Subscriptions show "Active" in IBKR Account Management
   - **API Acknowledgement**: Submitted at 4:15 PM ET (requires 15-30 min propagation)

### Current Blockers (Expected Resolution: Next Session)

- **Error 10089**: "Requested market data requires additional subscription for API" ‚è≥
  - **Root Cause**: API acknowledgement pending propagation (submitted 4:15 PM ET)
  - **Expected Resolution**: 15-30 minutes after submission (should be active by next session)
  - **Current State**: Subscriptions active in portal, Gateway restarted multiple times
  - **Test Results**: Delayed data only (bid/ask/last all `nan`), 30 bars returned

- **Empty Options Chain**: `reqSecDefOptParams returned empty chain list` ‚è≥
  - **Root Cause**: Linked to Error 10089; options data unavailable without active API subscription
  - **Expected Resolution**: Should resolve once Error 10089 clears

### Key Infrastructure Status
| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| SSH Authentication | ‚úÖ Working | Passwordless with RSA 4096-bit key |
| Event Loop Threading | ‚úÖ Fixed | 20-min test passed, production-ready |
| Broker Connection | ‚úÖ Working | Live Gateway (192.168.7.205:4001) |
| Live Account | ‚úÖ Connected | With `dry_run=true` safety |
| Market Data Subs | ‚è≥ Pending | Active in portal, API acknowledgement propagating |
| Real-time Data | ‚è≥ Pending | Waiting for acknowledgement (15-30 min) |
| RTH Guard | ‚úÖ Working | Bot only runs 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET |
### Configuration Changes
| Setting | Old Value | New Value | Reason |
|---------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| `broker.port` | 4002 (paper) | 4001 (live) | Paper accounts lack subscription access |
| `broker.client_id` | 101 | 101 | Restored to default after testing |
| `symbols` | ["SPY"] | ["SPY"] | Restored to default after testing |
| `dry_run` | true | true | ‚ö†Ô∏è **SAFETY MAINTAINED** |

### Lessons Learned
1. **Paper Account Limitations**: Cannot access market data subscriptions in IBKR portal; must use live account with `dry_run=true` for real-time data testing
2. **API Acknowledgements Required**: IBKR requires explicit acknowledgement submission after subscription purchase (15-30 min propagation time)
3. **Gateway Client ID Management**: Connections persist ~60 seconds after disconnect; increment client_id for rapid testing
4. **RTH Guard Works**: Bot only runs during market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET) to conserve resources

### Next Session Priorities
1. **Immediate**: Verify Error 10089 resolved (should be active after acknowledgement propagation)
2. **Short-term**: Extended stability test (1+ hour during market hours)
3. **Medium-term**: Strategy signal validation with real-time data
4. **Long-term**: Production readiness review before live deployment decision

## Errors, Root Causes, and Fixes (Historical Log)

### Issue 1: Event Loop Threading (2026-01-02) ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Root Cause**: ThreadPoolExecutor worker threads lack asyncio event loops; ib_insync requires event loop in calling thread
- **Error**: `RuntimeError: There is no current event loop in thread 'ThreadPoolExecutor-1_0'`
- **Solution**: Added event loop creation in `_with_broker_lock()` before broker calls (commit f9ed836)
- **Validation**: 20-minute stability test passed (4 cycles, 0 crashes)

### Issue 2: Option Chain Missing underlyingConId (2026-01-02) ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Root Cause**: `ib_insync.IB.reqSecDefOptParams()` requires underlyingConId parameter
- **Error**: `TypeError: IB.reqSecDefOptParams() missing 1 required positional argument: 'underlyingConId'`
- **Solution**: Qualify underlying contract first to get conId, pass to reqSecDefOptParams (commit 685d993)

### Issue 3: Market Data Subscription (2026-01-02) ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS
- **Root Cause**: IBKR API acknowledgement pending propagation
- **Error**: Error 10089 "Requested market data requires additional subscription for API"

## START HERE NEXT SESSION

### üöÄ Quick Start (First 5 Minutes)

**See [NEXT_SESSION_START_HERE.md](NEXT_SESSION_START_HERE.md) for detailed quick start guide.**

#### Immediate Actions:
1. **Test Subscription Status** (2 min):
   ```bash
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa saladbar751@192.168.7.117 "cd ~/ibkr-options-bot && source ~/.venv/bin/activate && python test_ibkr_connection.py --host 192.168.7.205 --port 4001 --client-id 160 --timeout 15"
   ```
   - **Success**: No Error 10089, bid/ask/last populated (not `nan`)
   - **Still Blocked**: Wait 15 more minutes or restart Gateway

2. **Run Bot** (3 min):
   ```bash
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa saladbar751@192.168.7.117 "cd ~/ibkr-options-bot && source ~/.venv/bin/activate && timeout 300 python -m src.bot.app"
   ```
   - **Success**: "Broker reconnected successfully", "Cycle decision" logged, no Error 10089
   - **Blocked**: Troubleshoot subscription (see NEXT_SESSION_START_HERE.md)

#### Session Goals:
- [ ] Verify Error 10089 resolved
- [ ] Confirm real-time bars flowing (60+ bars)
- [ ] Validate strategy signals with live data
- [ ] Extended stability test (1+ hour)
- [ ] Production readiness review

---

## Session Summary (2025-01-01) - Initial Paper Trading Phase

**Previous Session Goal**: Validate complete data flow and confirm strategy signals generate correctly with real market data
   python test_ibkr_connection.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4002 --timeout 10
   ```

2. **Pi Connectivity** (5 min)
   ```bash
   ssh saladbar751@192.168.7.117
   cd ~/ibkr-options-bot && source .venv/bin/activate
   python test_ibkr_connection.py --host 192.168.7.205 --port 4002 --timeout 10
   # Expected: Connection successful, 46 bars returned
   ```

3. **Bot Startup** (2 min)
   ```bash
   # On Pi
   cd ~/ibkr-options-bot && python -m src.bot.app
   # Expected: Account loads, heartbeats every ~3 min, 46 bars/cycle
   ```

4. **Log Monitoring** (10 min - first cycle)
   ```bash
   # On Pi (separate terminal)
   tail -50 logs/bot.log | grep -E "cycle|signal|insufficient|order|ERROR"
   # Expected: See cycle start/end, "insufficient bars" or signal decisions
   ```

#### Validation Steps

**Step 1: Verify Data Flow (10 min)**
- Bot runs 5-minute cycles continuously
- Each cycle: fetches 46 bars ‚Üí evaluates strategy ‚Üí logs signal or skip
- Account balance loads correctly ($1,013,348.83 baseline)
- No crashes or event loop errors in logs

**Step 2: Confirm Strategy Signals** (20 min - 4 cycles)
- Monitor logs for scalp_rules signal evaluation (BUY/SELL/HOLD confidence scores)
- If market conditions trigger signals, verify confidence calculation is correct
- Check whale_rules debounce logic works (3-day per-symbol cooldown)
- Expected output: `[symbol=SPY, signal=HOLD, confidence=0.0]` or similar

**Step 3: Test Dry-Run Order Creation** (10 min - conditional)
- If signal triggers and dry_run=true, verify:
  - Log shows "Dry-run: Would place order..." instead of actual order
  - No real orders appear in IBKR account
  - Thread safety is maintained (no concurrent order conflicts)
  - Bracket order parameters logged correctly (entry, TP%, SL%)

**Step 4: Monitor Scheduler Stability** (ongoing)
- Run for 30+ minutes without stopping
- Verify no memory leaks (check Pi cpu/memory with `top`)
- Heartbeats continue every ~3 minutes
- No reconnect spam in logs
- Symbols are processed in ThreadPoolExecutor without deadlock

#### Common Issues & Quick Fixes

| Issue | Check | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Bot won't start | `python -c "import src.bot.app"` | Check Python 3.11, venv activated, deps installed |
| Timeout on 192.168.7.205 | Gateway running? Remote connections enabled? | Restart Gateway on Windows |
| "Insufficient bars" constantly | Check bar count in logs | Expected if < 30 bars; market may be quiet |
| "Error 321" returns | Update ibkr.py duration? | Check commit 88879d1; should be "3600 S" |
| Signals never trigger | Check RSI/EMA logic | Review scalp_rules thresholds; adjust if market is flat |

#### Next Actions After Validation

- **If all tests pass**: Update this README with validation timestamp and move to Phase 2 (paper trading with real account)
- **If data flow blocked**: Check logs for specific errors; grep for "ERROR\|Exception\|321" and cross-reference copilot-instructions.md
- **If signals trigger**: Document signal examples and confidence scores; prepare for bracket order testing
- **If signals never trigger**: Review market conditions during test window; consider adjusting scalp_rules thresholds or extending test duration

#### Key Metrics to Record

After 1 hour of stable running, capture:
- Number of complete cycles: `grep -c "Processing symbol" logs/bot.log`
- Signal decisions: `grep "signal=" logs/bot.log | tail -10`
- Error count: `grep -c "ERROR" logs/bot.log`
- Bar fetch success: `grep "bars returned" logs/bot.log | wc -l`

#### Session Notes
- Dry-run mode **remains true** until explicitly approved for paper trading
- Paper port is **4002** (not 4001 live); never switch without explicit user approval
- If restarting bot frequently: stop Pi bot with `pkill -f "python -m src.bot.app"` to clean up
- Logs rotate at 10MB; full history in `logs/bot.jsonl` (JSON for parsing)

## Session Summary (2026-01-09) ‚≠ê Signal Handling + Scheduler Stability ‚Äî RESOLVED

Today‚Äôs focus was fixing premature shutdowns seen in VS Code terminals and ensuring the bot stays up reliably. We implemented explicit Gateway connection in the app entry point, deferred signal handling during the connection phase, and added an interruptible stop event to the scheduler.

### What Changed
- ‚úÖ Explicit `broker.connect()` before entering the scheduler (app startup)
- ‚úÖ Signal handler defers SIGINT/SIGTERM while connecting to prevent `asyncio.CancelledError`
- ‚úÖ Scheduler accepts `stop_event` and uses interruptible sleep for graceful exits
- ‚úÖ Improved startup logs for symbols, risk settings, and alert channels

### Verified
- ‚úì Gateway connects to 192.168.7.205:4001 with `client_id=261`
- ‚úì Bot stays up in VS Code terminals; no early shutdown after ~9s
- ‚úì 117/117 tests passing; no regressions
- ‚úì Off-hours behavior: sleeps silently outside RTH (09:30‚Äì16:00 ET)

### Run Inside VS Code (Windows)
```powershell
# Activate venv in the VS Code terminal
& .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Optional: ignore signals during long dry-run testing
$env:BOT_IGNORE_SIGNALS = "1"

# Start the bot
python -m src.bot.app

# View logs
Get-Content -Tail 80 -Wait logs/bot.log
```

### START HERE NEXT SESSION (during RTH)
- Confirm Gateway is running and shows API Connected.
- In VS Code terminal:
  - Activate venv: `& .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
  - Start bot: `python -m src.bot.app`
  - Monitor logs: `Get-Content -Tail 80 -Wait logs/bot.log`
- Success criteria (first 10‚Äì15 minutes):
  - Cycle completes in under ~10s
  - Historical fetch shows `[HIST] Completed` with 60+ bars
  - No circuit breaker opens; no timeouts
