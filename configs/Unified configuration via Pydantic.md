Unified configuration via Pydantic

“Create a Settings class that loads configuration from both configs/settings.yaml and environment variables using Pydantic. Include typed fields for broker host/port/client ID, symbols, risk limits (max_risk_pct_per_trade, max_daily_loss_pct, take_profit_pct, stop_loss_pct, whale_alloc_pct), schedule interval, and options contract preferences (expiry, moneyness, liquidity thresholds). Provide sensible defaults and validation (e.g., percentages between 0 and 1). Refactor the bot to instantiate a single Settings object at startup and replace direct environment and YAML lookups with attributes from this class.”

Implement historical price retrieval

“Implement the historical_prices method in IBKRBroker. Use IBKR’s API to request minute‑bar history for a given symbol and timeframe (e.g., last 30–60 minutes) and return a pandas DataFrame with open, high, low, close and volume. Update data/market.py to call this method instead of assuming only live ticks.”

Refine option contract selection

“Improve option selection logic: in data/options.py, write a function that picks the nearest‑Friday weekly option at‑the‑money or slightly in‑/out‑of‑the‑money based on current underlying price. Add filters for minimum volume and maximum bid‑ask spread. Expose these thresholds in the settings.”

Complete OCO/Bracket order handling

“Finish the emulate_oco logic in execution.py. When a parent order fills, spin up a thread that monitors option prices at a configurable interval. If the take‑profit threshold is hit, send a limit sell; if the stop‑loss threshold is hit, send a market sell. Cancel the opposing child order to avoid double execution. Prefer IBKR’s native bracket orders when supported; fall back to emulation otherwise. Ensure this works in paper trading before live deployment.”

Daily loss guard and risk management

“Add a function to record the account’s equity at the start of each trading day and compare it against current equity on every cycle. If losses exceed max_daily_loss_pct, stop opening new positions and log a warning. Persist the start‑of‑day equity (e.g. to a file) so the bot survives restarts. Integrate this check into the scheduler before placing trades.”

Expand logging and observability

“Enhance logging: for every cycle, log the signal decision (BUY/SELL/HOLD), confidence score, selected option contract, and reason for skipping (e.g., illiquid). Use structured logging (JSON) so logs are parseable. At the end of each day, log a summary of total trades, win/loss count and P&L. Optionally, add a lightweight dashboard or generate a daily report.”

Continuous Integration pipeline

“Add a .github/workflows/ci.yml GitHub Actions workflow that checks out the repo, installs dependencies (caching pip), runs make fmt to enforce formatting, ruff for linting, mypy for type checking and pytest for tests. Fail the build if any step fails. Consider a separate job to build a Docker image for release.”

Pre‑commit hooks

“Add a .pre-commit-config.yaml with hooks for Black, Ruff and Mypy. Update the README to instruct developers to install pre‑commit and run pre-commit install so style and type checks run before commits.”

Containerization

“Write a Dockerfile that uses the official Python 3.11 slim image, installs system dependencies (e.g., libxml2, libz), copies your code, installs Python requirements and sets an entrypoint to python -m src.bot.app. Optionally write a docker-compose.yml to run IBKR Gateway in one service and the bot in another, with environment variables loaded from .env.”

Monitoring and alerts

“Add a monitoring module that pings a configurable heartbeat URL (e.g. Healthchecks.io) at the start of each cycle and sends notifications via Slack/Telegram/email when errors occur or when the bot stops trading due to daily loss limits. Make endpoints and tokens configurable via settings.”

Parallelism and scalability

“Refactor the scheduler to handle multiple symbols concurrently. Consider using asyncio or Python threads so data fetching and strategy execution don’t block each other. Ensure thread safety when updating shared state (positions, P&L). Expose a configuration option for the maximum number of concurrent symbols.”

Unit tests and stubs

“Expand the test suite with unit tests for scalp_rules and whale_rules using sample pandas DataFrames; tests for risk.position_size and daily loss guard; and an integration test that uses a stubbed broker returning deterministic data to simulate a scheduler cycle. Use pytest fixtures to set up sample data and assert expected signals and order placements.”

Security hardening

“Confirm .gitignore excludes .env and logs/trades files. Enforce file permissions on .env so it’s readable only by the process owner. Ensure sensitive values never appear in logs. Document a ‘dry‑run’ mode that prevents order execution and remind developers to use it when testing on new hardware.”

Future roadmap and scaling

“Create a roadmap in the repository documenting the crawl/walk/run phases: start on Raspberry Pi (single strategy, paper trading), move to R620 (multi‑strategy, CI/CD, containerization), and eventually to a GPU‑capable server for deep‑learning strategies. Outline the hardware prerequisites and configuration steps for each phase.”
