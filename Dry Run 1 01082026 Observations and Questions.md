Now that we have run some dry runs. What would the results have been if this were trading live money? 
Give detailed analysis of the strategy and how it was used and what the net results would expect to be over several hours etc. 
Will the discord notifications be able to include message alerts every time a buy/sell is performed and will it include the net result? Amount gained/lost etc?To analyze the potential results of the trading strategy if it were applied to live money, we need to consider several factors including the strategy's win rate, average profit/loss per trade, frequency of trades, and market conditions during the trading period.
Help me understand the nature of the historical fetches and how they were used to inform the strategy. For instance, if the strategy was based on technical indicators such as moving averages, RSI, or MACD, we would need to evaluate how these indicators performed historically in the chosen market. Additionally, when the Historical data timeout occurred, it is important to understand if it was due to API limitations, network issues, or other factors that could impact the reliability of the strategy. "Skipping: Insufficient bars" indicates that there were not enough data points to make informed decisions, which could lead to missed opportunities or erroneous trades. The purpose of the bot is to automate trading decisions based on predefined criteria, and any interruptions in data fetching could compromise its effectiveness.
