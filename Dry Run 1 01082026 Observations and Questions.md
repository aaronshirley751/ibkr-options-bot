Now that we have run some dry runs. What would the results have been if this were trading live money? 
Give detailed analysis of the strategy and how it was used and what the net results would expect to be over several hours etc. 
Will the discord notifications be able to include message alerts every time a buy/sell is performed and will it include the net result? Amount gained/lost etc?To analyze the potential results of the trading strategy if it were applied to live money, we need to consider several factors including the strategy's win rate, average profit/loss per trade, frequency of trades, and market conditions during the trading period.
Help me understand the nature of the historical fetches and how they were used to inform the strategy. For instance, if the strategy was based on technical indicators such as moving averages, RSI, or MACD, we would need to evaluate how these indicators performed historically in the chosen market. Additionally, when the Historical data timeout occurred, it is important to understand if it was due to API limitations, network issues, or other factors that could impact the reliability of the strategy. "Skipping: Insufficient bars" indicates that there were not enough data points to make informed decisions, which could lead to missed opportunities or erroneous trades. The purpose of the bot is to automate trading decisions based on predefined criteria, and any interruptions in data fetching could compromise its effectiveness.
I see "2026-01-08 09:53:45.873 [UY] INFO  [JTS-usoptDispatcherS9-126S9-127] - LOG Client 214 Output exceeded limit (was: 100004), removed first half

" indicates that the logging output exceeded a certain limit, which suggests that the bot was generating a significant amount of data. This could be a sign of high activity levels, but it also raises concerns about performance and the ability to track important events effectively. Help me understand how logging is managed and whether critical information is being captured without overwhelming the system.

The repeated log entries indicating "Writing to output data. Written: 0 Left: 5000010" suggest that the bot is attempting to write a significant amount of data but is not successfully writing any of it. This could indicate a bottleneck in the data writing process, possibly due to system resource limitations or issues with the data storage mechanism. The warning about a timeout waiting for EWriter to send data further supports this, indicating that the system is struggling to keep up with the volume of data being generated. This could lead to delays in processing trades and potentially missing out on profitable opportunities.
To summarize, if this trading strategy were applied to live money, the net results would depend heavily on the reliability of data fetching, the effectiveness of the trading criteria, and the system's ability to handle high volumes of data without performance degradation. Over several hours, if the strategy has a high win rate and is able to execute trades efficiently, we could expect positive returns. However, if data fetching issues persist or if the logging system overwhelms the bot's processing capabilities, this could lead to significant losses or missed opportunities.
